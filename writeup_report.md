# CarND-Controls-PID

Writeup report for the submission of the PID Control Project

## Introduction

This project implements a PID Controller in C++. The PID Controller generates steer values for a vehicle using the crosstrack error (CTE) as input from the Udacity simulator.

The steering angle generated by the PID controller is the negative sum of the products of three coefficients with their respective error terms. Each product in the sum plays a different role in the steering angle value.

The three coefficients are the following:

| coeff name | respective error term |
|:----------:|:---------------------:|
| Kp         | proportional          |
| Ki         | integral              |
| Kd         | differential          |
