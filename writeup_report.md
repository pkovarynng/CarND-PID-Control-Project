# CarND-Controls-PID

Writeup report for the submission of the PID Control Project

---

## Introduction

This project implements a PID Controller in C++. The PID Controller generates steer values for a vehicle using the crosstrack error (CTE) as input from the Udacity simulator.

The steering angle generated by the PID controller is the negative sum of the products of three coefficients with their respective error terms. Each product in the sum plays a different role in the steering angle value.

The three coefficients are the following:

| coeff name | respective error term |
|:----------:|:---------------------:|
| Kp         | proportional          |
| Ki         | integral              |
| Kd         | differential          |

## Tuning

The proportional error term, p_error in the code, is the CTE. The product Kp \* p_error is the component of the steering angle that is proportional to the CTE. The effect of this component is that the vehicle oscillates around the center line. If I set only the Kp component in the code to non-zero and left the other two coeffs as zero then the oscillations became large around the first turn and the vehicle lost the road very shortly.

## Final Parameters

The final parameters, the PID coefficients, were chosen through manual tuning. The final set of values were the following:

| coeff name | value |
|:----------:|:---------------------:|
| Kp         | 0.25          |
| Ki         | 0              |
| Kd         | 0.75          |
